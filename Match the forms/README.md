A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/zimjs/pen/BaooqBb](https://codepen.io/zimjs/pen/BaooqBb).

Matching games are fun but can be conceptually complex.  Here is a demo that can have its objects replaced with any objects, pictures, etc.  At the request of some young ZIMsters.

ZIM provides JavaScript conveniences, components and controls for the Canvas and is powered by CreateJS with its solid Bitmap Object Model (BOM). Code Creativity with ZIM!
